pyiron_base - an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science. It combines several tools
in a common platform:

• Hierarchical data management – interfacing with storage resources like SQL and `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.

• Object oriented job management – for scaling complex simulation protocols from single jobs to high-throughput simulations.

pyiron (called pyron) is developed in the `Computational Materials Design department <https://www.mpie.de/CM>`_ of
`Joerg Neugebauer <https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386>`_ at the `Max Planck Institut für Eisenforschung (Max
Planck Institute for iron research) <https://www.mpie.de/2281/en>`_. While its original focus was to provide a framework
to develop and run complex simulation protocols as needed for ab initio thermodynamics it quickly evolved into a
versatile tool to manage a wide variety of simulation tasks. In 2016 the `Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced
Materials Simulation (ICAMS) <http://www.icams.de>`_ joined the development of the framework with a specific focus on
high throughput applications. In 2018 pyiron was released as open-source project.

.. note::

    **pyiron_base**: This is the documentation page for the basic infrastructure moduls of pyiron.  If you're new to
    pyiron and want to get an overview head over to `pyiron <https://pyiron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.  If you're
    looking for the API docs of the atomistic simulation packages check `pyiron_atomistics
    <https://pyiron_atomistics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

**************
Explore pyiron
**************
We provide various options to install, explore and run pyiron:

* :ref:`Workstation Installation (recommeded) <InstallLocal>`: for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X workstations (interface for local VASP executable, support for the latest jupyterlab based GUI)

* :ref:`Mybinder.org (beta) <InstallBinder>`: test pyiron directly in your browser (no VASP license, no visualization, only temporary data storage)

* :ref:`Docker (for demonstration) <InstallDocker>`: requires Docker installation (no VASP license, only temporary data storage)

Please contact us if you are interested in using pyiron:

* to interface your simulation code or method

* implementing high-throughput approaches based on atomistic codes

* to learn more about method development and Big Data in material science.
