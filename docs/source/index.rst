The :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager provides the data storage and job management for the `pyiron <https://pyiron.org>`_
project. As part of the modularization of the `pyiron <https://pyiron.org>`_ project in 2018, the monolithic code base
which started as :code:`pyCMW` back in 2011 was split in :code:`pyiron_base` and :code:`pyiron_atomistics`. This split
highlights the separation of the technical complexity and workflow management in :code:`pyiron_base` and the physics
modelling for atomistic simulation in :code:`pyiron_atomistics`.

Features:
---------

* Calculation which can be either simple python functions or external executables written in any programming language can be wrapped in :code:`pyiron_base` to enable parameter studies with thousands or millions of calculation.
* The calculation can either be executed locally on the same computer or on high performance computing (HPC) resources. The python simple queuing system adapter `pysqa <https://pysqa.readthedocs.io>`_ is used to interface with the HPC queuing systems directly from python and the `pympipool <https://pympipool.readthedocs.io>`_ package is employed to assign dedicated resources like multiple CPU cores and GPUs to individual python functions.
* Scientific data is efficiently stored using the `hierarchical data format (HDF) <https://www.hdfgroup.org>`_ via the `h5py <https://www.h5py.org>`_ python library and more specifically the `h5io <https://github.com/h5io>`_ packages to match the python datatypes to the HDF5 data types.

With this functionality the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager enables the rapid prototyping and up-scaling of
parameter studies for a wide range of scientific application. Starting from simulation codes written in Fortran without
any Python bindings, over more modern modelling codes written in C or C++ with Python bindings up to machine learning
models requiring GPU acceleration, the approach follows the same three steps:

#. Implement a wrapper for the simulation code, which takes a set of input parameters calls the simulation code and returns a set of output parameters. For a simulation code with python bindings this is achieved with the :code:`wrap_python_function()` function and for any external executable which requires file-based communication this is achieved with the :code:`create_job_class()` function which requires only a :code:`write_input()` function and a :code:`collect_output()` function to parse the input and output files of the external executable. Both functions return a :code:`job` object. This is the central building block of the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager.
#. Following the map-reduce pattern a series of :code:`job` objects are created and submitted to the available computing resources. When the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager is executed directly on the login node of a HPC cluster, the calculation are directly submitted to the queuing system. Alternatively, the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager also supports submission via an secure shell (SSH) connection to the HPC cluster. Still in contrast to many other workflow managers, the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager does not require constant connection to the remote computing resources. Once the :code:`job` objects are submitted the workflow can be shutdown.
#. Finally, after the execution of the individual :code:`job` objects is completed the :code:`pyiron_table` object gathers the data of the individual :code:`job` objects in a single table. The table is accessible as :code:`pandas.DataFrame` so it is compatible to most machine learning and plotting libraries for further analysis.

Example:
--------

As the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager was developed as part of the `pyiron <https://pyiron.org>`_ project the
implementation of the `quantum espresso <https://www.quantum-espresso.org>`_ density functional theory (DFT) simulation
code in the :code:`pyiron_base` workflow manager is chosen as example. Still the same steps apply for any kind of
simulation code: ::

    import os
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from ase.build import bulk
    from ase.calculators.espresso import Espresso
    from ase.io import write
    from pwtools import io


    def write_input(input_dict, working_directory="."):
        filename = os.path.join(working_directory, 'input.pwi')
        os.makedirs(working_directory, exist_ok=True)
        write(
            filename=filename,
            images=input_dict["structure"],
            Crystal=True,
            kpts=input_dict["kpts"],
            input_data={"calculation": input_dict["calculation"]},
            pseudopotentials=input_dict["pseudopotentials"],
            tstress=True,
            tprnfor=True
        )


    def collect_output(working_directory="."):
        filename = os.path.join(working_directory, 'output.pwo')
        try:
            return {"structure": io.read_pw_md(filename)[-1].get_ase_atoms()}
        except TypeError:
            out = io.read_pw_scf(filename)
            return {
                "energy": out.etot,
                "volume": out.volume,
            }


    def workflow(project, structure):
        # Structure optimization
        job_qe_minimize = pr.create.job.QEJob(job_name="qe_relax")
        job_qe_minimize.input["calculation"] = "vc-relax"
        job_qe_minimize.input.structure = structure
        job_qe_minimize.run()
        structure_opt = job_qe_minimize.output.structure

        # Energy Volume Curve
        energy_lst, volume_lst = [], []
        for i, strain in enumerate(np.linspace(0.9, 1.1, 5)):
            structure_strain = structure_opt.copy()
            structure_strain = structure.copy()
            structure_strain.set_cell(
                structure_strain.cell * strain**(1/3),
                scale_atoms=True
            )
            job_strain = pr.create.job.QEJob(
                job_name="job_strain_" + str(i)
            )
            job_strain.input.structure = structure_strain
            job_strain.run(delete_existing_job=True)
            energy_lst.append(job_strain.output.energy)
            volume_lst.append(job_strain.output.volume)

        return {"volume": volume_lst, "energy": energy_lst}


    from pyiron_base import Project
    pr = Project("test")
    pr.create_job_class(
        class_name="QEJob",
        write_input_funct=write_input,
        collect_output_funct=collect_output,
        default_input_dict={  # Default Parameter
            "structure": None,
            "pseudopotentials": {"Al": "Al.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF"},
            "kpts": (3, 3, 3),
            "calculation": "scf",
        },
        executable_str="mpirun -np 1 pw.x -in input.pwi > output.pwo",
    )

    job_workflow = pr.wrap_python_function(workflow)
    job_workflow.input.project = pr
    job_workflow.input.structure = bulk('Al', a=4.15, cubic=True)
    job_workflow.run()

    plt.plot(job_workflow.output.result["volume"], job_workflow.output.result["energy"])
    plt.xlabel("Volume")
    plt.ylabel("Energy")

After the definition of the :code:`write_input()` and :code:`collect_output()` function for the quantum espresso DFT
simulation code the :code:`workflow()` function is defined to combine multiple quantum espresso DFT simulation. First
the structure is optimized to identify the equilibrium volume and afterwards five strains ranging from 90% to 110% are
applied to determine the bulk modulus. Finally, in the last few lines all the individual pieces are put together, by
creating :code:`QEJob` the quantum espresso job class based on the :code:`write_input()` and :code:`collect_output()`
function and then wrapping the :code:`workflow()` function using the :code:`wrap_python_function()`. The whole workflow
is executed when the :code:`run()` function is called. Afterwards the results are plotted using the :code:`matplotlib`
library.
