The `pyiron_base` workflow manager provides the data storage and job management for the [pyiron](https://pyiron.org)
project. As part of the modularization of the [pyiron](https://pyiron.org) project in 2018, the monolithic code base
which started as `pyCMW` back in 2011 was split in `pyiron_base` and `pyiron_atomistics`. This split highlights the 
separation of the technical complexity and workflow management in `pyiron_base` and the physics modelling for atomistic 
simulation in `pyiron_atomistics`.

## Features:

* Calculation which can be either simple python functions or external executables written in any programming language 
  can be wrapped in `pyiron_base` to enable parameter studies with thousands or millions of calculation.
* The calculation can either be executed locally on the same computer or on high performance computing (HPC) resources.
  The python simple queuing system adapter [pysqa](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io) is used to interface with the HPC 
  queuing systems directly from python and the [pympipool](https://pympipool.readthedocs.io) package is employed to 
  assign dedicated resources like multiple CPU cores and GPUs to individual python functions.
* Scientific data is efficiently stored using the [hierarchical data format (HDF)](https://www.hdfgroup.org) via the 
  [h5py](https://www.h5py.org) python library and more specifically the [h5io](https://github.com/h5io) packages to 
  match the python datatypes to the HDF5 data types.

With this functionality the `pyiron_base` workflow manager enables the rapid prototyping and up-scaling of parameter 
studies for a wide range of scientific application. Starting from simulation codes written in Fortran without any Python
bindings, over more modern modelling codes written in C or C++ with Python bindings up to machine learning models 
requiring GPU acceleration, the approach follows the same three steps:

* Implement a wrapper for the simulation code, which takes a set of input parameters calls the simulation code and
  returns a set of output parameters. For a simulation code with python bindings this is achieved with the 
  `wrap_python_function()` function and for any external executable which requires file-based communication this is 
  achieved with the `create_job_class()` function which requires only a `write_input()` function and a `collect_output()`
  function to parse the input and output files of the external executable. Both functions return a `job` object. This is
  the central building block of the `pyiron_base` workflow manager.
* Following the map-reduce pattern a series of `job` objects are created and submitted to the available computing 
  resources. When the `pyiron_base` workflow manager is executed directly on the login node of a HPC cluster, the
  calculation are directly submitted to the queuing system. Alternatively, the `pyiron_base` workflow manager also 
  supports submission via an secure shell (SSH) connection to the HPC cluster. Still in contrast to many other workflow 
  managers, the `pyiron_base` workflow manager does not require constant connection to the remote computing resources. 
  Once the `job` objects are submitted the workflow can be shutdown.
* Finally, after the execution of the individual `job` objects is completed the `pyiron_table` object gathers the data 
  of the individual `job` objects in a single table. The table is accessible as `pandas.DataFrame` so it is compatible 
  to most machine learning and plotting libraries for further analysis.

## Example:
As the `pyiron_base` workflow manager was developed as part of the [pyiron](https://pyiron.org) project the
implementation of the [quantum espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org) density functional theory (DFT) simulation
code in the `pyiron_base` workflow manager is chosen as example. Still the same steps apply for any kind of simulation 
code:
```python
 import os
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import numpy as np
 from ase.build import bulk
 from ase.calculators.espresso import Espresso
 from ase.io import write
 from pwtools import io


 def write_input(input_dict, working_directory="."):
     filename = os.path.join(working_directory, 'input.pwi')
     os.makedirs(working_directory, exist_ok=True)
     write(
         filename=filename,
         images=input_dict["structure"],
         Crystal=True,
         kpts=input_dict["kpts"],
         input_data={"calculation": input_dict["calculation"]},
         pseudopotentials=input_dict["pseudopotentials"],
         tstress=True,
         tprnfor=True
     )


 def collect_output(working_directory="."):
     filename = os.path.join(working_directory, 'output.pwo')
     try:
         return {"structure": io.read_pw_md(filename)[-1].get_ase_atoms()}
     except TypeError:
         out = io.read_pw_scf(filename)
         return {
             "energy": out.etot,
             "volume": out.volume,
         }


 def workflow(project, structure):
     # Structure optimization
     job_qe_minimize = pr.create.job.QEJob(job_name="qe_relax")
     job_qe_minimize.input["calculation"] = "vc-relax"
     job_qe_minimize.input.structure = structure
     job_qe_minimize.run()
     structure_opt = job_qe_minimize.output.structure

     # Energy Volume Curve
     energy_lst, volume_lst = [], []
     for i, strain in enumerate(np.linspace(0.9, 1.1, 5)):
         structure_strain = structure_opt.copy()
         structure_strain = structure.copy()
         structure_strain.set_cell(
             structure_strain.cell * strain**(1/3),
             scale_atoms=True
         )
         job_strain = pr.create.job.QEJob(
             job_name="job_strain_" + str(i)
         )
         job_strain.input.structure = structure_strain
         job_strain.run(delete_existing_job=True)
         energy_lst.append(job_strain.output.energy)
         volume_lst.append(job_strain.output.volume)

     return {"volume": volume_lst, "energy": energy_lst}


 from pyiron_base import Project
 pr = Project("test")
 pr.create_job_class(
     class_name="QEJob",
     write_input_funct=write_input,
     collect_output_funct=collect_output,
     default_input_dict={  # Default Parameter
         "structure": None,
         "pseudopotentials": {"Al": "Al.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF"},
         "kpts": (3, 3, 3),
         "calculation": "scf",
     },
     executable_str="mpirun -np 1 pw.x -in input.pwi > output.pwo",
 )

 job_workflow = pr.wrap_python_function(workflow)
 job_workflow.input.project = pr
 job_workflow.input.structure = bulk('Al', a=4.15, cubic=True)
 job_workflow.run()

 plt.plot(job_workflow.output.result["volume"], job_workflow.output.result["energy"])
 plt.xlabel("Volume")
 plt.ylabel("Energy")
```

After the definition of the `write_input()` and `collect_output()` function for the quantum espresso DFT simulation code
the `workflow()` function is defined to combine multiple quantum espresso DFT simulation. First the structure is 
optimized to identify the equilibrium volume and afterwards five strains ranging from 90% to 110% are applied to 
determine the bulk modulus. Finally, in the last few lines all the individual pieces are put together, by creating 
`QEJob` the quantum espresso job class based on the `write_input()` and `collect_output()` function and then wrapping 
the `workflow()` function using the `wrap_python_function()`. The whole workflow is executed when the `run()` function 
is called. Afterwards the results are plotted using the `matplotlib` library.
