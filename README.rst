pyiron - an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science. While the general pyiron framework is focused on atomistic simulations, pyiron_base is independent of atomistic simulation. It can be used as a standalone workflow management combining a hierachical storage interface based on HDF5, support for HPC computing clusters and a user interface integrated in the Jupyter environment. 

Installation
------------
You can test pyiron on `Mybinder.org (beta) <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyiron/pyiron_base/main?urlpath=lab>`_.
For a local installation we recommend to install pyiron inside an `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_  environment::

    conda install -c conda-forge pyiron_base

See the `Documentation-Installation <https://pyiron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html>`_ page for more details.

Example
-------
After the successful configuration you can start your first pyiron calculation. Navigate to the the projects directory and start a jupyter notebook or jupyter lab session correspondingly::

    cd ~/pyiron/projects
    jupyter notebook

Open a new jupyter notebook and inside the notebook you can now validate your pyiron calculation by creating a test project::

    from pyiron import Project
    pr = Project('test')
    pr.path


Getting started:
----------------
Test pyiron with mybinder:
