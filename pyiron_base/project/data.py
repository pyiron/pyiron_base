"""
A modified data container for storing associating data with a project.

Spec:
    The `Project` class should have data associated with it which can be stored to-file in our supported format(s)
    (right now just hdf5). This should meet the following requirements:

    - Data storage is immediately accessible, i.e. appearing in the project tab-completion module
    - Data stored there should be readable and writeable with a single parameter-free call
    - When instantiated, new projects should automatically read any available data (not *quite* satisfied right now!)
    - The `Project` tab completion menu should not get cluttered (i.e. nest everything under `Project.foo`)
