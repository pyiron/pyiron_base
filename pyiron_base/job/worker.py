    """
    The WorkerJob executes jobs linked to its master id.

    The worker can either be in the same project as the calculation it should execute
    or a different project. For the example two projects are created:

    >>> from pyiron_base import Project
    >>> pr_worker = Project("worker")
    >>> pr_calc = Project("calc")

    The worker is configured to be executed in the background using the non_modal mode,
    with the number of cores defining the total number avaiable to the worker and the
    cores_per_job definitng the per job allocation. It is recommended to use the same
    number of cores for each task the worker executes to optimise the load balancing.

    >>> job_worker = pr_worker.create.job.WorkerJob("runner")
    >>> job_worker.server.run_mode.non_modal = True
    >>> job_worker.server.cores = 4
    >>> job_worker.input.cores_per_job = 2
    >>> job_worker.run()

    The calculation are assinged to the worker by setting the run_mode to worker and
    assigning the job_id of the worker as master_id of each job. In this example a total
    of ten toyjobs are attached to the worker, with each toyjob using two cores.

    >>> for i in range(10):
    >>>     job = pr_calc.create.job.ToyJob("toy_" + str(i))
    >>>     job.server.run_mode.worker = True
    >>>     job.server.cores = 2
    >>>     job.master_id = job_worker.job_id
    >>>     job.run()

    The execution can be monitored using the job_table of the calculation object:

    >>> pr_calc.job_table()

    Finally after all calculation are finished the status of the worker is set to collect,
    which internally stops the execution of the worker and afterwards updates the job status
    to finished:

    >>> pr_calc.wait_for_jobs()
    >>> job_worker.status.collect = True
