class ScriptJob(GenericJob):
    """
    The ScriptJob class allows to submit Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to the pyiron job management system.

    Args:
        project (ProjectHDFio): ProjectHDFio instance which points to the HDF5 file the job is stored in
        job_name (str): name of the job, which has to be unique within the project

    Simple example:
        Step 1. Create the notebook to be submitted, for ex. 'example.ipynb', and save it -- Can contain any code like:
                ```
                import json
                with open('script_output.json','w') as f:
                    json.dump({'x': [0,1]}, f)  # dump some data into a JSON file
                ```

        Step 2. Create the submitter notebook, for ex. 'submit_example_job.ipynb', which submits 'example.ipynb' to the
                pyiron job management system, which can have the following code:
                ```
                from pyiron_base import Project
                pr = Project('scriptjob_example')  # save the ScriptJob in the 'scriptjob_example' project
                scriptjob = pr.create.job.ScriptJob('scriptjob')  # create a ScriptJob named 'scriptjob'
                scriptjob.script_path = 'example.ipynb'  # specify the PATH to the notebook you want to submit.
                ```

        Step 3. Check the job table to get details about 'scriptjob' by using:
                ```
                pr.job_table()
                ```

        Step 4. If the status of 'scriptjob' is 'finished', load the data from the JSON file into the
                'submit_example_job.ipynb' notebook by using:
                ```
                import json
                with open(scriptjob.working_directory + '/script_output.json') as f:
                    data = json.load(f)  # load the data from the JSON file
                ```

    More sophisticated example:
        The script in ScriptJob can also be more complex, e.g. running its own pyiron calculations.
        Here we show how it is leveraged to run a multi-core atomistic calculation.

        Step 1. 'example.ipynb' can contain pyiron_atomistics code like:
                ```
                from pyiron_atomistics import Project
                pr = Project('example')
                job = pr.create.job.Lammps('job')  # we name the job 'job'
                job.structure = pr.create.structure.ase_bulk('Fe')  # specify structure

                # Optional: get an input value from 'submit_example_job.ipynb', the notebook which submits
                #   'example.ipynb'
                number_of_cores = pr.data.number_of_cores
                job.server.cores = number_of_cores

                job.run()  # run the job

                # save a custom output, that can be used by the notebook 'submit_example_job.ipynb'
                job['user/my_custom_output'] = 16
                ```

        Step 2. 'submit_example_job.ipynb', can then have the following code:
                ```
                from pyiron_base import Project
                pr = Project('scriptjob_example')  # save the ScriptJob in the 'scriptjob_example' project
                scriptjob = pr.create.job.ScriptJob('scriptjob')  # create a ScriptJob named 'scriptjob'
                scriptjob.script_path = 'example.ipynb'  # specify the PATH to the notebook you want to submit.
                                                         # In this example case, 'example.ipynb' is in the same
                                                         # directory as 'submit_example_job.ipynb'

                # Optional: to submit the notebook to a queueing system
                number_of_cores = 1  # number of cores to be used
                scriptjob.server.cores = number_of_cores
                scriptjob.server.queue = 'cmfe'  # specify the queue to which the ScriptJob job is to be submitted
                scriptjob.server.run_time = 120  # specify the runtime limit for the ScriptJob job in seconds

                # Optional: save an input, such that it can be accessed by 'example.ipynb'
                pr.data.number_of_cores = number_of_cores
                pr.data.write()

                # run the ScriptJob job
                scriptjob.run()
                ```

        Step 3. Check the job table by using:
                ```
                pr.job_table()
                ```
                in addition to containing details on 'scriptjob', the job_table also contains the details of the child
                'job/s' (if any) that were submitted within the 'example.ipynb' notebook.

        Step 4. Reload and analyse the child 'job/s': If the status of a child 'job' is 'finished', it can be loaded
                into the 'submit_example_job.ipynb' notebook using:
                ```
                job = pr.load('job')  # remember in Step 1., we wanted to run a job named 'job', which has now
                                      # 'finished'
                ```
                this loads 'job' into the 'submit_example_job.ipynb' notebook, which can be then used for analysis,
                ```
                job.output.energy_pot[-1]  # via the auto-complete
                job['user/my_custom_output']  # the custom output, directly from the hdf5 file
                ```

    Attributes:

        attribute: job_name

            name of the job, which has to be unique within the project

        .. attribute:: status

            execution status of the job, can be one of the following [initialized, appended, created, submitted, running,
                                                                      aborted, collect, suspended, refresh, busy, finished]

        .. attribute:: job_id

            unique id to identify the job in the pyiron database

        .. attribute:: parent_id

            job id of the predecessor job - the job which was executed before the current one in the current job series

        .. attribute:: master_id

            job id of the master job - a meta job which groups a series of jobs, which are executed either in parallel or in
            serial.

        .. attribute:: child_ids

            list of child job ids - only meta jobs have child jobs - jobs which list the meta job as their master

        .. attribute:: project

            Project instance the jobs is located in

        .. attribute:: project_hdf5

            ProjectHDFio instance which points to the HDF5 file the job is stored in

        .. attribute:: job_info_str

            short string to describe the job by it is job_name and job ID - mainly used for logging

        .. attribute:: working_directory

            working directory of the job is executed in - outside the HDF5 file

        .. attribute:: path

            path to the job as a combination of absolute file system path and path within the HDF5 file.

        .. attribute:: version

            Version of the hamiltonian, which is also the version of the executable unless a custom executable is used.

        .. attribute:: executable

            Executable used to run the job - usually the path to an external executable.

        .. attribute:: library_activated

            For job types which offer a Python library pyiron can use the python library instead of an external executable.

        .. attribute:: server

            Server object to handle the execution environment for the job.

        .. attribute:: queue_id

            the ID returned from the queuing system - it is most likely not the same as the job ID.

        .. attribute:: logger

            logger object to monitor the external execution and internal pyiron warnings.

        .. attribute:: restart_file_list

            list of files which are used to restart the calculation from these files.

        .. attribute:: job_type

            Job type object with all the available job types: ['ExampleJob', 'SerialMaster', 'ParallelMaster', 'ScriptJob',
                                                               'ListMaster']

        .. attribute:: script_path

            the absolute path to the python script
