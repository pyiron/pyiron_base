This is a central control point for all the queue adapters, i.e. how we talk to remote computing power.
Before this class was written, we only ever used the first queue adapter we found defined in the resources.
That behaviour is maintained, but now with `QueueAdapters` we can trivially extend to using multiple resources and
multiple adapters.
