"""
The `state` module holds (almost!) all the code for defining the global state of a pyiron instance.
Such "global" behaviour is achieved by using the `Singleton` metaclass to guarantee that each class only even has a
single instance per session.
These are all instantiated for the first time inside their respective module for easy access, and collected here in the
init under the `state` object to give a single, even easier point of access.

Here's the "almost": Right now the database management still lives off in its own module but is referenced here and
ultimately should probably be relocated here (work is ongoing on our database interaction...), and there is a
`JobTypeChoice` class that is anyhow on the chopping block and will be deleted once we don't need it for backwards
compatibility.
